          Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as
          small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big
          as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear).
          They're found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and
          Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          They have nonretractable claws, short tails, and excellent sense of
          smell. They're typically solitary, except for mothers with cubs. There
          are eight species: Asiatic black bears (also called moon bears), brown
          bears (which include grizzly bears), giants pandas, North American
          black bears, polar bears, sloth bears, spectacled bears (also called
          Andean bears, and sun bears.
        </p>
        <p>
          On average, bears can live up to 25 years in the wild and 50 in
          captivity. Six species, including the polar bear and the giant panda,
          are included on the IUCN Red List as threatened or vulnerable.
